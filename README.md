# MayaPlugins
Python plugins for MAYA.


The goal of this project was to use the Maya Python API to create a IK/FK blend plugin for artists to use  during the pre-production process.  Maya is an Autodesk product that has two methods of interaction: the Maya Commands or the Maya API.  For this project we chose to use the Maya Python API to develop our prototype because it was the easiest for beginners to understand.


For more information look at our MayaPythonAPI_report.pdf documentation which discusses how to use our plugin and how it was developed.
